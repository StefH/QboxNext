# Coding style

## .editorconfig

An `.editorconfig` is included with our preferred code style. 

- Visual Studio 2017 supports a subset of these rules out of the box
- Extended Resharper rules are included. Make sure to enable the options for Resharper to use .editorconfig
- VSCode support is limited

## Documentation
- Prefer to avoid inline code comments, the code should describe itself
- Prefer XML documentation. Describe all public classes, methods, parameters, etc. conforming to Microsoft's practices.
